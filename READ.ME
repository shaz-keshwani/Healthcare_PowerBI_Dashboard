# Project Description:

The dataset contains information on patients, staff, departments, beds, length of stay, feedback, 
and financial metrics across multiple regions and age groups.
The Power BI report summarizes key KPIs such as total patients, in‑patients vs out‑patients, occupied beds,
ICU cases, deaths, ER time, and total revenue, and then breaks them down by state, department, age bucket, gender, and patient status.

# Business Problem:

Hospital leaders need a clear view of how efficiently beds, staff, and departments are being used, which patient segments generate most demand 
and revenue, and where care quality or outcomes may be at risk. 
Previously, this information was scattered in raw tables, making it hard to monitor KPIs like length of stay, mortality, ICU usage, 
and ER wait time across locations and age groups.

# Solution Provided:

A Power BI dashboard was built to transform the raw dataset into an interactive, self‑service analytics tool for hospital management.
The report includes slicers for department and month, cards for high‑level KPIs, and multiple charts (bar, line, pie, gauge) to monitor patient status,
feedback, length of stay, beds and staff by state, and revenue by age bucket.

# Key Findings:

Total patients are a little over 2,500, with most being in‑patients; out‑patients are a smaller share but still important.

Bed occupancy is high (over 1,700 beds in use out of about 3,500), showing strong demand for hospital beds.

ICU and death counts are noticeable (over 80 ICU cases and more than 80 total deaths), so critical‑care outcomes should be watched.

Average ER time is around the mid‑60s, and some departments such as Dermatology show higher ER times than others.

The 6–20 and 41–60 age groups have the highest patient counts and also contribute the biggest share of revenue.

Male and female patients are almost evenly split, giving a balanced gender ratio.

British Columbia has the highest number of patients and deaths as well as many staff, making it a key state to manage carefully.

Some departments (like OPD/Outpatient and Physical Medicine) have many more beds than smaller departments such as Oncology or Cardiology, which may limit capacity in those smaller units.
